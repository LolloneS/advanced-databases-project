# Advanced Databases 2ECTS Project's Report
# Global Commodity Trade Statistics 
# Lorenzo Soligo - 806954

## Abstract
In this report I will compare the performances of a MongoDB database which uses some collections linked with references versus a MongoDB database using a one-collection embedded-document structure, whilst working with a huge dataset (~1GB, 8+ million rows) representing trades statistics for many countries, with and without indexes.

## Dataset
[Global Commodity Trade Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/global-commodity-trade-statistics) by [United Nations](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations)

### Fields
The dataset fields are:
* `country_or_area`:
  * name of the country or area the trade refers to
* `year`:
  * year in which the trade was done
* `comm_code`
  * code of the commodity traded
* `commodity`
  * name of the commodity traded
* `flow`
  * flow of the trade: Import, Export, ...
* `trade_usd`
  * amount of the trade, in US dollars
* `weight_kg`
  * weight of the commodity traded, in kilograms
* `quantity_name`
  * type of quantity (e.g. number of items, weight in kilograms, ...)
* `quantity`
  * number representing the quantity (e.g. number of items = 5)
* `category`
  * category of the trade




## Single collection, embedded structure

### Modeling the dataset

Modeling the dataset requires thinking about the best way to embed the fields in order to achieve clarity, ease of use and good performance.

After some reasoning, I think this is one of the best choices that could be made for the dataset. 
Every document represents a single trade.

* `ID` (generated by Mongo)
* `country_or_area`
* `year`
* `commodity`
  - `name`
  - `code`
  - `category`
* `trade_details`
  * `flow`
  * `weight_kg`
  * `trade_usd`
  * `quantity`
  * `quantity_name`



#### Sample document

```js
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5b06df5f0cea1a1aa46b4ce2"),
 	"country_or_area" : "Afghanistan",
 	"year" : "2016",
 	"commodity" : {
        "name" : "Sheep, live",
        "code" : "010410",
        "category" : "01_live_animals"
    },
 	"trade_details" : {
        "flow" : "Export",
        "weight_kg" : 2339,
        "trade_usd" : 6088,
        "quantity" : 51,
        "quantity_name" : "Number of items"
    }
}    
```





## Two collections with references

### Document structure (example)

Structuring the database using more than one collection lets us divide the *commodities* from the rest of the data regarding the trades, giving us the advantage of saving space - since many commodities are repeated thousands of times over the dataset's millions of rows

The rows will be thus splitted in two collections this way:

1. **trades**

* `ID` (generated by Mongo)
* `country_or_area`
* `year`
* `commodity`
* `trade_details`
  - `flow`
  - `weight_kg`
  - `trade_usd`
  - `quantity`
  - `quantity_name`

2. **commodities**

* `ID` (generated by Mongo)
* `name`
* `code`
* `category`



#### Sample document

**Trade**
```js
{
   "_id":ObjectId("5b081ed80cea1a1a64ca495b"),
   "country_or_area":"Afghanistan",
   "year":"2016",
   "comm_code":"010410",
   "trade_details":{
      "flow":"Export",
      "weight_kg":2339,
      "trade_usd":6088,
      "quantity":51,
      "quantity_name":"Number of items"
   }
}
```



**Commodity**

```js
{
   "_id":ObjectId("5b0820620cea1a1a6447cdab"),
   "name":"Oak or chestnut tanning extract",
   "code":"320130",
   "category":"32_tanning_dyeing_extracts_tannins_derivs_pigments_et"
}
```

## Conclusions
As we can see, the queries' execution times are similar given the two structures adopted.
The embedded structure usually performs slightly better because of the time saved by avoiding the use `lookup` to "join" documents taken from two different collections.
The structure using references, on the other hand, performs way better when only data about the commodities is analyzed, because 1) the commodities are only a few thousands and 2) the commodities' documents are actually pretty small. 



## Some extra stuff

I created some Python scripts in order to parse and import the dataset into MongoDB.

I also tried to automate the process of setting the database up, creating indexes and running the queries as much as possible. This also helped me in measuring the time taken by every single step.
